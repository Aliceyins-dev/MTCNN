# MTCNN
Face detection source code based on MTCNN

   MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Netword) is a neural network model for face detection task proposed by ShenZhen institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2016. It is also a popular neural network model for rapid face detection and key point positioning of face. The MTCNN model consists of three sub-networks, namely P-Net, R-Net and O-Net. P-Net is used to quickly generate candidate boxes and finds as many bounding boxes as possible. R-Net is responsible for further refinement of the screening bounding box, while O-Net makes the final screening judgment for the bounding box and locates the key points of the face.
   The CelebA dataset is selected for the training data set, which contains 202,599 face images of 10177 celebrity identities. Each image is marked with features, including face bounding box, 5 coordinates of face-feature points and 40 attributes. A random shift is made at the center of the face label box. By calculating the IOU values of the offset box and bounding box, training samples were made. Partial samples: 0.4<IOU<0.65, marked as 2; Negative sample: IOU<0.3, marked as 0. Because the label box of the CelebA data set itself is deviated, the IOU threshold can be adjusted when the sample is made, keeping the positive sample: partial sample: negative sample =1:1:3.
